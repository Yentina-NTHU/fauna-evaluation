I need to create a study plan. How should I start?,advise,Buzz! Start by breaking down your topics and allocating time for each!,359
"That sounds like a good idea! I have a few subjects I need to focus on, so I can list them out and then plan some time for each. How much time should I be thinking about for each subject?",advise,"Buzz! Aim for 1-2 hours per subject, with breaks in between to stay fresh!",445
"Okay, that makes sense! I can do 1-2 hours per subject and take short breaks in between. Maybe I could also use my breaks to doodle or listen to music to recharge. What’s the best way to break up my study sessions?",advise,"Buzz! Try the Pomodoro Technique: study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break!",541
