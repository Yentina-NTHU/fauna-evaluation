How should I decide how much time to dedicate to each subject?",advise,"Buzz! To decide how much time to dedicate to each subject, consider your comfort level with each topic and the weight of each subject in your exams. Spend more time on subjects you find challenging and less on those you feel confident in, but aim for balance to ensure all areas are covered. Also, factor in review sessions before the exams to reinforce your learning!",1129,10,10
